# Java Type Conversion
- Type conversions between primitive data types are known as "narrowing" and "widening". 

## Widening (Implicit Type Conversion)
Widening, or implicit conversion, is when a smaller data type is automatically converted to a larger data type. This type of conversion does not lose any data and is done automatically by the Java compiler.

```java
    int intValue = 100;
    long longValue = intValue; // int to long
    float floatValue = longValue; // long to float
    double doubleValue = floatValue; // float to double
```

## Widening Conversion Rules:
byte to short, int, long, float, double
short to int, long, float, double
char to int, long, float, double
int to long, float, double
long to float, double
float to double

## Narrowing (Explicit Type Conversion)
Narrowing, or explicit conversion, is when a larger data type is converted to a smaller data type. This conversion is not done automatically and can result in loss of data or precision. To perform narrowing conversion, a cast must be used.

```java
    double doubleValue = 100.04;
    float floatValue = (float) doubleValue; // double to float
    long longValue = (long) floatValue; // float to long
    int intValue = (int) longValue; // long to int
    short shortValue = (short) intValue; // int to short
    byte byteValue = (byte) shortValue; // short to byte
```

## Narrowing  Conversion Rules:
double to float, long, int, short, byte, char
float to long, int, short, byte, char
long to int, short, byte, char
int to short, byte, char
short to byte, char
char to byte, short


## `float` vs `long` Exception:
`float` - 4 byte
`long` - 8 byte

float -> long   // Narrowing
long -> float   // Widening

* Reason
    - range of float > range of long
    - Also narrowing is related to **LOSS OF DATA**, as range of float >  range of long, converting `float` -> `long` is narrowing 
    -**Precision Loss:** From float to long: This conversion can lead to a loss of the fractional part and precision because the long type cannot represent decimal values.
