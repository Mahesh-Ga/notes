# Garbage Collection Process

## Initial State:

**Heap Setup:**
- Young generation heap with an Eden space and two survivor spaces (S0 and S1).
- Old generation space.

**Objects:**
- Several objects created, some allocated in the Eden space.

## First Minor GC (Cycle 1):

**Trigger:**
- The Eden space becomes full.

**Process:**
- The garbage collector performs a minor GC.
- It scans objects in the Eden space.
- Reachable objects are moved to one of the survivor spaces (e.g., S0).
- Unreachable objects are reclaimed.

**Outcome:**
- Some objects are now in S0.
- The Eden space is cleaned up.

## Subsequent Minor GC (Cycle 2):

**Trigger:**
- The Eden space fills up again.
- The survivor space S0 becomes full.

**Process:**
- Another minor GC is triggered.
- Objects from the Eden space and the survivor space S0 are examined.
- Reachable objects are moved to the other survivor space (S1).
- Some objects in S0 that are still reachable are moved to S1.

**Outcome:**
- Objects are now in S1.
- The Eden space is cleaned up again.

## Promotion to Old Generation (Cycle 3):

**Trigger:**
- An object survives multiple minor GC cycles (e.g., it has been in S0 and S1 several times).

**Process:**
- The garbage collector moves these long-lived objects from the young generation to the old generation.

**Outcome:**
- Objects are now in the old generation, which is managed less frequently.

## Major GC (Cycle 4):

**Trigger:**
- The old generation becomes full.
- A major GC is triggered due to explicit request or JVM conditions.

**Process:**
- A major GC occurs, examining both the young and old generations.
- All unreachable objects in both spaces are reclaimed.
- The surviving objects in the old generation may be compacted to reduce fragmentation.

**Outcome:**
- The old generation is cleaned up.
- Memory is reclaimed.



# Garbage Collection Details: 

1. **Survivor Space**
    Definition: In the Java heap memory, the young generation is divided into several areas, including two survivor spaces (S0 and S1). These spaces hold objects that have survived one or more garbage collection cycles from the Eden space.
    Purpose: To manage objects that have survived minor garbage collections and to provide a way to age objects before they are promoted to the old generation.
2. **Eden Space**
    Definition: A part of the young generation where new objects are initially allocated.
    Purpose: To hold new objects and manage short-lived object allocation. When the Eden space fills up, a minor garbage collection occurs to reclaim space.
3. **Old Generation (Old Space)**
    Definition: The area of the Java heap that holds objects that have survived multiple garbage collections from the young generation.
    Purpose: To manage long-lived objects. Full garbage collections (or old generation GCs) occur here to reclaim space.
4. **Metaspace**
    Definition: A memory area where JVM stores metadata about classes and methods (replacing PermGen in Java 8 and later).
    Purpose: To store information about loaded classes and methods. It grows automatically as needed, subject to available system memory.
5. **Code Cache**
    Definition: A memory area where the JVM stores compiled native code (such as JIT-compiled methods).
    Purpose: To improve performance by caching machine code generated by the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler.
6. **Garbage Collection (GC)**
    Definition: The process of automatically reclaiming memory by removing objects that are no longer in use by the application.
    Types:
    Minor GC: Occurs in the young generation (Eden and Survivor spaces). It is less expensive and occurs more frequently.
    Full GC: Occurs in the old generation as well as the young generation. It is more expensive and occurs less frequently but reclaims more space.
7. **Young Generation GC (YGC)**
    Definition: A garbage collection event that occurs in the young generation to reclaim space from the Eden and Survivor spaces.
    Purpose: To manage short-lived objects and prevent the young generation from filling up.
8. **Full GC (FGC)**
    Definition: A garbage collection event that occurs in the entire heap, including both young and old generations.
    Purpose: To reclaim space from the old generation and reduce the overall heap usage.
9. **GC Time (YGCT, FGCT)**
    Definition: The time spent by the garbage collector to perform garbage collection events.
    Purpose: To measure the impact of garbage collection on application performance. High GC times can indicate performance issues.
10. **Allocation**
    Definition: The process of reserving memory for new objects in the heap.
    Purpose: To manage memory for application objects. High allocation rates can lead to frequent garbage collections.
11. **Promotion**
    Definition: The process of moving objects from the young generation (Survivor spaces) to the old generation.
    Purpose: To manage long-lived objects that have survived multiple garbage collections.
12. **Heap Memory**
    Definition: The portion of JVM memory used for dynamic memory allocation, where objects are created and managed.
    Purpose: To provide a space for the Java application to allocate memory for objects.

    **Survivor Spaces:** Manage short-lived objects between garbage collections.
    **Code Cache:** Holds compiled native code to improve performance.
    **Eden Space:** Where new objects are allocated.
    **Old Space:** Holds long-lived objects that have survived multiple garbage collections.
    **Metaspace:** Stores class and method metadata.
    **YGC & YGCT:** Monitor the performance of young generation garbage collections.
    **FGC & FGCT:** Monitor the performance of full garbage collections.
