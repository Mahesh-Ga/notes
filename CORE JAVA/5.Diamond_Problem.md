## Diamond Problem: 

The Diamond Problem is a well-known issue in object-oriented programming, particularly in languages that support multiple inheritance. It occurs when a class inherits from two classes that have a common base class. This creates an ambiguity because it's unclear which path should be followed to inherit properties and methods from the base class.

Example of the Diamond Problem
Consider the following scenario in a hypothetical language that supports multiple inheritance:
    A
   / \
  B   C
   \ /
    D
Class A is the base class.
Classes B and C inherit from A.
Class D inherits from both B and C.
When D tries to access a property or method from A, it's ambiguous whether it should access the one through B or C.

## How Java Solves the Diamond Proble ? 
- Java *does not support multiple inheritance* of classes, meaning a class cannot inherit from more than one class directly.
- This design decision inherently avoids the Diamond Problem.
- Instead, Java provides **interfaces**, which allow for a form of multiple inheritance. Interfaces can be implemented by any class, and a class can implement multiple interfaces.

### Default Methods in Interfaces
With Java 8 and later, interfaces can have **default** methods. If two interfaces provide a default method with the same signature, the implementing class must resolve the conflict by overriding the method.
