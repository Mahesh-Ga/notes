## Recursion 
- **Base Case:** Every recursive function needs a base case, which is a condition that stops the recursion. This prevents the function from calling itself indefinitely. The base case is usually a simple condition that can be solved directly without further recursion.

- **Recursive Case:** If the base case is not met, the function makes a recursive call to itself with modified arguments. This is where the problem is broken down into smaller subproblems.

- **Function Call Stack:** Each recursive call creates a new stack frame, which is a record of the function's execution. This includes local variables, the point to return to after the function completes, and other details. These frames are stacked on top of each other, and each frame has its own set of variables.

- **Returning Values:** When the base case is reached, the function returns a value. This value is then passed back up the stack of recursive calls. Each function call receives this return value and performs its part of the computation before returning to its caller.

- **Unwinding the Stack:** Once the base case is reached and the function starts returning values, the stack begins to unwind. Each function call completes and its stack frame is removed until the original function call is reached and completes.
